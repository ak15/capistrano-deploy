# Capistrano actions
Github deploy action for Capistrano. Use this action to automate your capistrano deployment process.

## Dependencies
Ruby should be installed with official ruby action (https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby)

## Inputs
### `target`
Environment where deploy is to be performed to. E.g. "production", "staging". Default value is empty

### `cap_path`
Path to Capistrano files. Can be left empty to use root of project.

### `deploy_key`
**Required** Symmetric key to decrypt private RSA key. Must be a string.

### `enc_rsa_key_pth`
**Required** Path to the encrypted key. Default `"config/deploy_id_rsa_enc"`.

## Outputs
No outputs

## Setting up CD using this action
1. Generate SSH keys on the target machine
```bash
$ ssh-keygen
```
2. Export public key to the `authorized_keys` to allow the usage of this keypair to login
```bash
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
3. Add public key from `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to your repository's deployment keys via *Settings / Deploy keys / Add*
4. Encrypt your private key with a strong password. **Please use these options**, otherwise this action may not be able to decrypt your key.
```bash
$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -md sha512 -salt -in .ssh/id_rsa -out deploy_id_rsa_enc -k PASSWORD -a
```
5. Add `deploy_id_rsa_enc` file to your repository. Suggested path is `config/deploy_id_rsa_enc`
6. Save the password used in step 4 as a secret in repository settings via *Settings / Secrets / Add*
7. Create YAML configuration for your workflow (example below)
